### Project Purpose

The BeMovie app was created during my training to gain hands-on experience with API integration. The goal was to develop a functional movie search application using HTML5, SASS, and JavaScript. The project allowed me to enhance my skills in front-end development and learn how to interact with external APIs. The app utilizes the [TMDB (The Movie Database) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for fetching movie-related data.
